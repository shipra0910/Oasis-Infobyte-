                    <h3>Abdul Kalam's Family and Struggle Life.</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="trans-con">
                    <ol>
                        <li style=" padding-bottom:5px;">
                            Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. 
                            He lived with his family in the temple city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque.
                             At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. 
                             Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family, from which he was the youngest.
                             His ancestors had been wealthy traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.
                              Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka,
                               as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a result, the family acquired the title of 
                               "Mara Kalam Iyakkivar" (wooden boat steerers), which over the years became shortened to "Marakier."
                                With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
                                 fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home 
                              As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a living.
                              By his early childhood, Kalam's family had become poor; at an early age, he sold newspapers to supplement his family's income.

                              In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described
                               as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. 
                               He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.

                    <h3>Educational Background Of Kalam</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="trans-con">
                    <ol>
                        <li style=" padding-bottom:5px;">Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense desire to learn. 
                            He spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in mathematics. 
                            Kalam left Schwartz higher secondary school after completing his early education and went to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. 
                            From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954.
                             He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.
                            
                             He was the writer of various motivational books like "India 2010", "Touched off Minds", "Mission India", "The Luminous Sparks", "Wings of Fire", and "Moving Thoughts".


                             His life, work, and convictions are loaded up with models and motivations. He will keep on inspiring us for eternity.
                              Furthermore, this is the genuine justification for why individuals from every one of the segments of the general public precipitously show love
                               for this incredible person on his miserable end at IIM Shillong on 27th July 2015.

                    <h3>Kalam as a scientist</h3>
                </div>

                    <ol>
                        <li style=" padding-bottom:5px;"> Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after graduation.
                             His career started with him designing a small hovercraft.
                              However, he was not convinced by his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project director of India's first satellite vehicle launch.
                               The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam received the Government's LV and Slv projects between the 1970s-90s.
                                He directed two projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these aerospace projects. 
                                His research and immense knowledge brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.
                                Kalam then went on to become the scientific advisor of the defence minister in 1992 and served at the same post for five years before getting promoted to the post of principal scientific advisor to the government. 
                                His immense role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power.
                                 Kalam had now become a national hero, to be remembered for ages to come. 
                                 However, the tests he conducted caused a huge uproar in the international community. 
                                 Kalam put forward a nationwide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which according to him, was a fantastic way for transforming the stature of India in 20 years, taking it from a developing to a developed nation. 
                                 The plan envisioned the progress of the nation by adopting advanced technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and emphasizing the education of the masses.

        <div class="legacy">
            <p> This complex persona was a notable researcher displaying huge and unending science and mechanical innovative work.
                 It was he who made our country atomic in its most genuine sense.
                  It was in the year 1974, under the oversight of Dr. Kalam, that India went through its most memorable atomic test. 
                  Next came the Pokhran - II in the year 1988. It was through these atomic tests
                   Dr. Kalam showed the world India's situation and power in atomic innovation.
                   Abdul Kalam was elected as the eleventh president of India in 2002 with the assistance of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
                    and the then-competition Indian National Congress. He is widely referred to as the "People's President". 
                    He spent four decades as a scientist and science administrator, especially on the 
                    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), 
                    and became concerned with India's civilian space program and army missile improvement efforts.
